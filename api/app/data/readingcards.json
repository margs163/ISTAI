    "text": "The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two."

    "topic": "The Rainbow Passage",
    "text": "When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."

    "topic": "Arthur the Rat",
    "text": "Once there was a young rat named Arthur who never could make up his mind. Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, 'I don't know.' He wouldn't say yes or no either. He would always shrink down and ask, 'What do you think?' This made his friends angry. They'd say, 'Arthur, we don't know what you want. You have to make up your own mind.' But Arthur never did make up his mind about anything."

    "topic": "The Grandfather Passage",
    "text": "You wish to know all about my grandfather. Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old, yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever. He dresses himself in an ancient black frock coat, usually minus several buttons; yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever. A long, flowing beard clings to his chin, giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect. When he speaks, his voice is just a bit cracked and quivers a trifle. Twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon our small organ."

    "topic": "The Caterpillar Passage",
    "text": "Do you like amusement parks? Well, I sure do. To amuse myself, I went twice last spring. My most memorable moment was riding on the Caterpillar, which is a gigantic rollercoaster high above the ground. When I saw how high the Caterpillar rose into the bright blue sky, I knew it was for me. After waiting in line for thirty minutes, I made it to the front where the man measured my height to see if I was tall enough. I gave the man my coins, asked for change, and jumped on the cart. Tick-tock, tick-tock."

    "topic": "Shopping Trip",
    "text": "Yesterday my mother and I went shopping at the mall. We needed to buy some new clothes for school and some shoes for my brother. First, we stopped at the department store where my mother tried on several dresses. She chose a beautiful blue one with white flowers. Then we went to the shoe store where we found the perfect pair of sneakers for my brother. They were red and black with white laces. After shopping, we were hungry, so we ate lunch at the food court. It was a wonderful day spent together."

    "topic": "The Library Visit",
    "text": "Last Thursday, I visited the public library to research my history project about ancient civilizations. The librarian helped me find several interesting books about Egyptian pyramids and Roman architecture. I spent three hours reading about pharaohs, emperors, and their magnificent buildings. The most fascinating chapter described how workers transported enormous stone blocks across great distances without modern machinery. I took careful notes and photocopied important pages for my bibliography. When closing time approached, I checked out four books and promised to return them within two weeks. Walking home, I felt excited about writing my report."

    "topic": "Cooking Disaster",
    "text": "My first attempt at baking chocolate chip cookies was absolutely catastrophic. I carefully measured all the ingredients: flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla extract. However, I accidentally confused salt with sugar and added three tablespoons instead of three teaspoons. When I tasted the raw batter, it was incredibly salty and completely inedible. I threw everything away and started over, this time reading the recipe more carefully. The second batch turned out perfectly golden brown and deliciously sweet. My family couldn't believe the difference between my first disaster and final success."

    "topic": "Moving Day",
    "text": "Moving to a new apartment requires tremendous planning and organization. First, we packed all our belongings into cardboard boxes, carefully labeling each container with its contents and destination room. The moving truck arrived promptly at eight o'clock in the morning with three strong workers. They wrapped our furniture in protective blankets and loaded everything efficiently. The journey to our new home took approximately two hours through heavy traffic. Unpacking proved even more challenging than packing, as we struggled to remember where we had placed important items. Finally, after a long exhausting day, we collapsed on our couch."
